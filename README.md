# Little Lemon Restaurant - Online Booking Feature

### Current Scenario
The restaurant currently relies on a manual booking process where customers must call the restaurant or visit in person to make a reservation. This process is time-consuming and inconvenient, especially for busy professionals like Jennifer Lawson, who have hectic schedules and limited time.

### Challenges Faced by Customers
- **Inconvenience**: Customers need to call during business hours or visit the restaurant in person to make a reservation, leading to long waiting times and frustration.
- **Uncertainty**: Without real-time information on table availability, customers face uncertainty about their desired reservation time, leading to potential double-bookings or no availability.
- **Limited Booking Hours**: Customers cannot make reservations outside of business hours, restricting their ability to plan ahead.
- **Alignment with Restaurant Hours**: Busy individuals, like Jennifer Lawson, may struggle to align their schedules with the restaurantâ€™s booking hours, leading to missed reservation opportunities.

### Operational Challenges for the Restaurant
- **Time-Consuming**: Staff spends considerable time handling reservations manually, which could be better spent on providing excellent customer service.
- **Error-Prone**: Manual entry increases the risk of errors such as double-bookings or incorrect entries, leading to customer dissatisfaction.
- **Data Management**: Lack of an automated system makes it difficult to collect and analyze data on customer preferences and peak booking times, hindering data-driven decision-making.

## Solution
Implementing an online booking feature will address these challenges by providing a convenient, efficient, and reliable way for customers to make reservations. This will enhance the overall customer experience, improve operational efficiency, and reduce the risk of errors, ultimately leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Design Concepts and Features

- **'Make a Reservation' Button**: Added to the Header for easy access to the booking system from any page within the app.
- **User-Friendly Booking System**: Designed to streamline the reservation process, making it intuitive and easy to use.
- **Table Reservation Component**: Allows customers to select their preferred seating area and make special requests.
